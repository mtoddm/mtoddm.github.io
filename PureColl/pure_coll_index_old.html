Title: <i> On singular stochastic dispersive PDEs
</i><br>

Abstract:
In this talk, I will go over some of the recent developments on nonlinear dispersive PDEs, such as the nonlinear Schroedinger equations (NLS) and nonlinear wave equations (NLW), with rough and random data and/or forcing.  In particular, taking the stochastic NLS and the stochastic nonlinear heat equations as examples, I will describe the difference between the dispersive and parabolic problems from the viewpoint of critical regularities, etc.  If time permits, I will also discuss some recent development for the stochastic NLW.

Title: <i> Permutation monoids and MB-homogeneous structures
</i><br>

Abstract:
There is a widely studied connection between subgroups of the infinite symmetric group and automorphisms of first-order structures; in particular, homogeneous structures (as characterised in the celebrated theorem of Fraisse) provide examples of interesting infinite permutation groups. This connection can be generalised in a surprising fashion, as there exist submonoids of the infinite symmetric group that are not necessarily groups; these are called permutation monoids. Much like the group case, there is a correspondence between permutation monoids and bimorphism monoids (monoids of bijective endomorphisms) of first-order structures. 
In this talk, I will explore this connection, introduce the idea of an MB-homogeneous structure and characterise these by demonstrating a Fraisse-like theorem. I will then go on to examine MB-homogeneous graphs in more detail, leading to some surprising results. 
The material in this talk almost wholly consists of work done during my PhD, and is joint with David Evans (Imperial) and Bob Gray (UEA).

Title: <i> Algebraic design theory
</i><br>

Abstract:
Algebraic perspectives and techniques have become increasingly
prevalent in combinatorial design theory. The designs of interest can
be viewed as square matrices whose rows (or columns) taken pairwise
obey a fixed constraint depending on the matrix size and coefficient
ring. Hadamard matrices and their generalisations are important
examples; the constraint in these cases is orthogonality.
The literature on Hadamard matrices is immense, covering numerous
applications in areas such as signal processing, cryptography, and
quantum computing.<br><br>

The algebraic approach has been especially successful in solving 
existence and classification problems for `cocyclic' designs, which 
are defined via certain regular subgroups of their automorphism groups.
The pairwise row/column constraint for cocyclic designs translates to
a simpler balance condition (e.g., a cocyclic matrix is Hadamard if
and only if all non-initial row sums are zero).<br><br>

We present a survey of algebraic design theory, emphasizing some key
results and open problems. In particular, we mention recent work
extending the notion of cocyclic design when necessary restrictions 
on matrix size are modified (e.g., what is the analogue of cocyclic 
Hadamard matrix when the size is even but not divisible by 4?). This arose
from considerations of the maximal determinant problem originally posed
by Hadamard.

Title: <i> Recent directions in Private Information Retrieval
</i><br>

Abstract:
Private Information Retrieval (PIR) is a technique that allows a user to obtain a record from a database without the database owner learning which record the user wishes to access.  One way to achieve this is for the user to download the entire database.  However, it is clearly desirable to construct PIR schemes in which this is not necessary.   In the unconditionally secure model (where we make no assumptions about the computational power of the database owners) interesting combinatorial problems arise naturally from the study of these schemes as we consider trade-offs between properties such as the size of the queries to the database, the number of bits downloaded from the database and the number of bits required for storing the database.  In this talk we will provide a background survey on unconditionally secure PIR before discussing some newer directions in the study of these schemes. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07027">https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07027</a>

Title: <i> Changing times in temporal graphs
</i><br>

Abstract:
Temporal graphs (in which edges are active only at specified time steps) are an increasingly important and popular model for a wide variety of natural and social phenomena.  I'll talk a bit about what's been going on in the world of temporal graphs, and then go on to the idea of graph modification in a temporal setting.<br><br> 

Motivated by cows and rumours, I'll talk about a particular modification problem in which we assign times to edges so as to maximise or minimise reachability sets within a temporal graph.  I'll mention an assortment of complexity results on these problems, showing that they are hard under a disappointingly large variety of restrictions.  In particular, if edges can be grouped into classes that must be assigned the same time, then the problem is hard even on directed acyclic graphs when both the reachability target and the classes of edges are of constant size, as well as on an extremely restrictive class of trees.  For fans of parameterised complexity, I'll note that one version of the problem is W[1]-hard when parameterised by the vertex cover number of the instance graph.   The situation is slightly better if each edge is active at a unique timestep - in some very restricted cases the problem is solvable in polynomial time. (Joint work with Kitty Meeks.)<br><br>
  
If you're not a lifelong fan of graphs or computational complexity, never fear! I will try to make this talk as enjoyable and accessible as possible, and will be sure to point out the important bits.  There will probably be at least one picture of livestock.

<b>John Mackay</b> (Bristol)<br>
Title: <i> Poincar&eacute inequalities and non-embeddings of groups and spaces
</i><br>

Abstract:
A classical Poincar&eacute inequality states that for a smooth function on a ball in Euclidean space, the L^p norm of the deviation of the function from its average is controlled by the L^p norm of the gradient of the function.  In recent years analogous inequalities have been studied on general metric spaces, where they may or may not hold depending on the particular space.<br><br>
In recent work with Hume and Tessera, we have introduced the "Poincar&eacute profile" of a space which measures, on large scale, to what extent such inequalities hold.  This idea generalises the "Separation Profile" of Benjamini, Schramm and Timar.  In this talk I'll survey some of the history and motivations of these ideas, and some results and applications of our work, for example to show non-embedding results for groups.

Title: <i> Identities in upper triangular matrix tropical semigroups and the bicyclic monoid
</i><br>

Abstract:
Izhakian and Margolis noted that the bicyclic monoid can be faithfully represented by $2 \times 2$ upper triangular tropical matrices, and furthermore that the semigroup of all such matrices satisfies Adjan's minimal length identity $ABBA AB ABBA = ABBA BA ABBA$ for the bicyclic monoid. In light of these results they posed the natural question of whether these two semigroups satisfy exactly the same semigroup identities.<br><br>

In joint work with Laure Daviaud and Mark Kambites, we provided a necessary and sufficient condition for an identity to hold in the semigroup $UT_n$ of $n \times n$ upper triangular tropical matrices, and used this result in the case $n=2$ to give a positive answer to the above. In further joint work with Ngoc Tran, we provide geometric methods and algorithms to verify, generate and enumerate $UT_n$ identities of a fixed length over a two letter alphabet. This leads to some new observations in the case of the bicyclic monoid.<hr>

Title: <i> Simple torsion groups of subexponential growth
</i><br>
Abstract: I will describe a new class of torsion groups (groups of Burnside
type) obtained by a simple procedure of "fragmenting" an action of the
infinite dihedral group on a Cantor set. The class contains many
interesting examples: a torsion group of piecewise isometries of a
polygon, the first example of a simple infinite finitely generated
group of sub-exponential growth, torsion groups associated with
irrational rotations of the circle, etc.

Title: <i> Renewal sequences in Markov chains and dynamical systems
</i><br>

Abstract:
In the first part of the talk I recall the notion of renewal sequences associated with Markov chains and explain the connection with mixing. In the second part of the talk I discuss how renewal sequences can be understood in the context of (deterministic) dynamical systems, including dynamical systems with infinite measure, and summarise some recent result on mixing.

Title: <i> Graph classes under homomorphic image order
</i><br>

Abstract:
Combinatorial structures have been considered under various orders, including substructure order and homomorphism order. In this talk, I will introduce and discuss the homomorphic image order, corresponding to the existence of a surjective homomorphism between two structures.  I will focus on partial well-order and antichains,  exploring how the homomorphic image order behaves in the context of graphs and graph-like structures.  In particular, I will discuss a near-complete characterization of partially well-ordered avoidance classes with one obstruction.  This is joint work with Nik Ruskuc.<hr>

Title: <i> Pseudo-Anosov maps with small entropy and the curve complex
</i><br>

Abstract:
The mapping class group of an orientable surface (of finite type) is the group or orientation preserving diffeormorphisms of the the surface modulo isotopy. There are three types of mapping classes (Thurston classification): finite order, reducible and pseudo-Anosov genearlising the classification for modular group $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$. From multiple perspectives, pseudo-Anosov maps are the most interesting type. This talk will survey the theory of pseudo-Anosov maps with small entropy. It will subsequently focus on deriving bounds in terms of genus for a particular notion of entropy: "translation distance in the curve complex". The main result is joint work with Chia-yen Tsai.<hr>

Title: <i> Word problems in one dimension
</i><br>

Abstract:
The word problem of a semigroup is the problem of deciding whether a pair of words over some generating set both represent the same element.  I will discuss the word problems of some semigroups - namely the free inverse and free left ample monoids of rank 1 - in which the elements can be viewed as intervals of integers containing a marked point.

Title: <i> Symmetry of digraphs

<b>Daniel Meyer</b> (Liverpool)<br>
Title: <i> Quasispheres and Expanding Thurston maps
</i><br>

Abstract:
A quasisymmetric map is one that changes angles in a controlled
way. As such they are generalizations of conformal maps and
appear naturally in many areas, including Complex Analysis and
Geometric group theory. A quasisphere is a metric sphere that is
quasisymmetrically equivalent to the standard $2$-sphere. An
important open question is to give a characterization of
quasispheres. This is closely related to Cannon's
conjecture. This conjecture may be formulated as stipulating that
a group that ``behaves topologically'' as a Kleinian group ``is
geometrically'' such a group. Equivalently, it stipulates that
the ``boundary at infinity'' of such groups is a quasisphere.

A Thurston map is a map that behaves ``topologically'' as a
rational map, i.e., a branched covering of the $2$-sphere that is
postcritically finite. A question that is analog to Cannon's
conjecture is whether a Thurston map ``is'' a rational map. This
is answered by Thurston's classification of rational maps. 

For Thurston maps that are expanding in a suitable sense, we may
define ``visual metrics''. The map then is (topologically
conjugate) to a rational map if and only if the sphere equipped
with such a metric is a quasisphere. This talk is based on joint
work with Mario Bonk.

Title: <i> Product-free Sets and Filled Groups
</i><br>

Abstract:
A subset $S$ of a group $G$ is product-free if for all $x$ and $y$ in $S$, the product $xy$ is not in $S$. This definition generalises the notion of sum-free sets of integers, where these sets were first studied. In this talk I'll: give an overview of what's known about sum-free and product-free sets in groups; introduce the related concept of filled groups; describe some joint work in this area with Chimere Anabanti and Grahame Erskine.

<b>Viveka Erlandsson</b> (Bristol)<br>
Title: <i>  Counting curves on surfaces
</i><br>
Abstract: It is a classical problem to try to count the number of closed curves on (hyperbolic) surfaces with bounded length. Due to people such as Delsart, Huber, and Margulis it is known that the asymptotic growth of the number of curves is exponential in the length. On the other hand, if one only looks at simple curves the growth is polynomial. Mirzakhani proved that the number of simple curves on a hyperbolic surface of genus $g$ of length at most $L$ is asymptotic to $L^{6g-6}$. Recently, she extended her result to also hold for curves with bounded self intersection, showing that the same polynomial growth holds. In this talk I will discuss her results and some recent generalizations.

Title: <i> On branch groups
</i><br>

Abstract:
 Stemming from the Burnside problem, branch groups have delivered lots of exotic examples over the past 30 years. Among them are easily describable finitely generated torsion groups, as well as the first example of a finitely generated group with intermediate word growth. We will investigate a generalisation of the Grigorchuk-Gupta-Sidki branch groups and talk about their maximal subgroups and about their profinite completion. Additionally, we demonstrate a link to a conjecture of Passman on group rings.

Title: <i> Bar-and-joint frameworks: Stresses and Motions
</i><br>

Abstract:
 Suppose that we have a framework consisting of finitely many fixed-length bars connected at universal joints.  Such frameworks (and variants) arise in many guises, with applications to the study of sensor networks, the matrix completion problem in statistics, robotics and protein folding. 

The fundamental question in rigidity theory is to determine if a framework is rigid or flexible.  The standard approach in combinatorial rigidity theory is to differentiate the quadratic equations constraining the distances between joints, and work with these linear equations to determine if the framework is infinitesimally rigid or flexible.  In this talk I will discuss recent progress using algebraic matroids that gives further insight into the infinitesimal theory and also provides methods for identifying special bar lengths for which a generically rigid framework is flexible.  We use circuit polynomials to identify stresses, or dependence relations among the linearized distance equations and to find bar lengths which give rise to motions.  This is joint work with Zvi Rosen, Louis Theran, and Cynthia Vinzant.

Title: <i> Groups with large p-residual finiteness growth
</i><br>

Abstract:
Residual finiteness growth for a group provides a way of
measuring how effectively the finite quotients measure the group. In this
talk, we will look at a family of groups acting on a rooted tree and
consider specifically the finite $p$-quotients. We will show how the
action on the tree provides a method for constructing groups of
arbitrarily large $p$-residual finiteness growth.

Title: <i> The complexity of valued constraint satisfaction problems
</i><br>

Abstract:
The Valued Constraint Satisfaction Problem (VCSP) is a well-known combinatorial problem. An instance of VCSP is given by a finite set of variables, a finite domain of labels for the variables, and a sum of functions, each function depending on a subset of the variables. Each function can take finite rational  values specifying costs of assignments of labels to its variables or the infinite value, which indicates an infeasible assignment. The goal is to find an assignment of labels to the variables that minimizes the sum. The case when all functions take only values 0 and infinity corresponds to the standard CSP. We study (assuming that $P\neq NP$) how the computational complexity of VCSP depends on the set of functions allowed in the instances, the so-called constraint language. Helped greatly by algebra, massive progress has been made in the last three years on this complexity classification question, and our work gives, in a way, the final answer to it, modulo the complexity of CSPs.<br><br>

This is joint work with Vladimir Kolmogorov and Michal Rolinek (both from IST Austria).

Title: <i> The Analyst's Traveling Salesman Theorem for large dimensional objects
</i><br>

Abstract:
The classical Analyst's Traveling Salesman Theorem of Peter Jones gives a condition for when a subset of Euclidean space can be contained in a curve of finite length (or in other words, when a "traveling salesman" can visit potentially infinitely many cities in space in a finite time). The length of this curve is given by a sum of quantities called beta-numbers that measure how non-flat the set is at each scale and location. Conversely, given such a curve, the sum of its beta-numbers is controlled by the total length of the curve, giving us quantitative information about how non-flat the curve is. This result and its subsequent variants have had applications to various subjects like harmonic analysis, complex analysis, and harmonic measure. In this talk, we will introduce a version of this theorem that holds for higher dimensional objects other than curves. This is joint work with Raanan Schul.

Title: <i> Number theory and Dynamical systems
</i><br>

Abstract:
Given a problem from number theory a useful technique is to rephrase it in terms of a property of a dynamical system. One can then use the statistical/topological properties of the dynamical system to gain more insight and hopefully solve the original problem. This talk will be an exposition of this technique and will include many examples.<hr>

<b>Phillip Wesolek</b> (Binghamton)<br>
Title: <i> Commensurated subgroups and periodic subgroups of tree almost automorphism groups
</i><br>

Abstract:
 (Joint work with A. Le Boudec) The tree almost automorphism groups are non-discrete locally compact completions of the Higman-Thompson groups. The tree almost automorphism groups are independently interesting locally compact groups, and furthermore every group that almost acts on a sufficiently regular rooted tree embeds into one of these groups.
   We begin by introducing the almost automorphism groups and describing their relationship to the Higman-Thompson groups. We then consider the subgroups such that every element is contained in a compact subgroup; such groups are the topological analogue of torsion subgroups and are called periodic. We show every periodic subgroup is indeed locally elliptic - i.e. every finite set is contained in a compact subgroup. As applications, we recover a result for Thompson's group V as well as a new observation about the R&ouml;ver group. We finally consider the commensurated subgroups of almost automorphism groups; these subgroups generalize normal subgroups. We show every commensurated closed subgroup of an almost automorphism group is either finite, compact and open, or equal to the entire group. As an application, we obtain new information on the possible lattice envelopes of Thompson's group T.

Title: <i> Counting points on curves and irreducible polynomials over finite fields
</i><br>

Abstract:
The number of irreducible polynomials over a finite field was first counted by Gauss. We will explain a connection between counting the number of irreducible polynomials over F_q with certain properties, and the number of rational points on some related algebraic curves. This idea can be used to count the number of irreducible polynomials with certain coefficients being 0. The appearance of supersingular curves explains the interesting periodic behaviour in the formulae, and new formulae are also obtained.<hr>

Title: <i> Constructing 2-closed Majorana representations
</i><br>

Abstract:
Majorana theory is an axiomatic framework in which to study objects related to the Monster group and its 196,884 dimensional representation, the Griess algebra. The theory was first developed in 2009 and was inspired by results by mathematicians such as M. Miyamoto and S. Sakuma who studied the Griess algebra using vertex operator algbras, objects used in the proof of Monstrous moonshine. The objects at the centre of the theory are known as Majorana algebras and can be studied either in their own right, or as Majorana representations of certain groups. I will be discussing my work, which builds on that of A. Seress, developing an algorithm to construct Majorana representations.<hr>

Title: <i> Brownian motion and Fourier decay 
</i><br>

Abstract:
Roughly speaking, a set is called a "Salem set" if it carries a measure whose Fourier transform decays polynomially with degree -s/2 where s is the Hausdorff dimension of the set (this is the fastest possible decay). Salem sets are often found via random processes, such as the random distortion of a Cantor set under Brownian motion. An old question of Kahane going back to the 1960s was whether or not the graph of classical Brownian motion is almost surely a Salem set. I will discuss this question in some detail: first I will show that the answer is 'no', and secondly I will show how to compute the optimal almost sure decay rate of the Fourier transform of measures supported on the graph.

I will keep technical detail to a minimum and will not assume (much) a priori knowledge of Fourier analysis, or probability theory.

This talk will include joint work with Tuomas Orponen (University of Helsinki) and Tuomas Sahlsten (University of Manchester).

Title: <i> Topological finiteness properties of monoids
</i><br>

Abstract:
Two fundamental finiteness properties in group theory are those of being finitely generated and of being finitely presented. These two properties were generalised to higher dimensions by C. T. C. Wall in 1965. A group G is said to be of type Fn if it has an Eilenberg-MacLane complex K(G,1) with finite n-skeleton. (Here K(G,1) is a certain nice topological space with fundamental group G.) It may be shown that a group is finitely generated if and only if it is of type F1 and is finitely presented if and only if it is of type F2. Related to this is a certain homological finiteness property called FPn. This property is defined for a monoid S in terms of the existence of certain resolutions of free left ZS-modules. The property FPn was introduced for groups by Bieri in (1976). In monoid and semigroup theory the property FPn arises naturally in the study of string rewriting systems. The connection between complete rewriting systems and homological finiteness properties is given by a result of Anick (1986) which shows that a monoid that admits such a presentation must be of type FPn for all n. The properties Fn and FPn are closely related. In particular, for finitely presented groups they are equivalent. <br><br>

Because of the connection with rewriting systems, the finiteness property FPn for monoids has received a great deal of attention in the literature. It is sometimes easier to establish the topological finiteness properties Fn for a group than the homological finiteness properties FPn, especially if there is a suitable geometry/topological space on which the group acts in a nice way. Currently no theory of Fn exists for monoids. In this talk I will describe some recent joint work with Benjamin Steinberg (City College of New York) which was motivated by the question of developing a useful notion of Fn for monoids. This led us to develop a theory of monoids acting on CW complexes. I will explain the ideas we have developed and some of their applications.

Title: <i> Growth of periodic orbits and amenability
</i><br>

Abstract:
The notion of an amenable group dates back to von Neumann in 1929, and appears in many different guises; such as in the Banach-Tarski paradox, and in the spectral geometry of manifolds. We discuss a more dynamical setting where amenability appears. Namely, we are interested in the growth of periodic orbits of the geodesic flow arising from negative curvature. No prior knowledge of these objects is assumed! This is joint work with R. Sharp.<hr>

Title: <i> Root systems and Clifford algebras: from symmetries of viruses to $E_8$ and an ADE correspondence 
</i><br>

Abstract:
In this talk I present a new take on polyhedral symmetries. I begin by describing that many viruses have icosahedrally symmetric surface structures. I briefly review recent work (with Reidun Twarock and Celine Boehm) to try and extend this symmetry principle also to the interior of viruses and carbon onions via suitable notions of affine extensions of non-crystallographic Coxeter groups. I have argued that in such reflection group settings (a vector space with an inner product) Clifford algebras are very natural objects to consider and in fact provide a very simple reflection formula. Applying this framework to root systems has led to the construction of the exceptional root system $E_8$ from the icosahedron and a proof that each 3D root system induces a corresponding 4D root system. In particular, the Trinity of irreducible 3D root systems $(A_3, B_3, H_3)$ gives rise to the Trinity of exceptional 4D root systems $(D_4, F_4, H_4)$. These exceptional root systems can thus be viewed as intrinsically three-dimensional phenomena. The countably infinite family $A_1\times I_2(n)$ gives rise to $I_2(n)\times I_2(n)$.  Arnold had found a very cumbersome and indirect connection between $(A_3, B_3, H_3)$ and $(D_4, F_4, H_4)$ essentially via exponents in the Coxeter plane. This in fact extends to my full correspondence between 3D and 4D root systems, establishing an ADE correspondence related to the McKay correspondence. Furthermore, one can fully factorise the Coxeter element in the Clifford algebra with the exponents and complex structures of the eigenplanes arising purely from the geometry, without the need to complexify the real vector space. <hr>

Title: <i> Rearrangement Groups of Self-Similar Spaces

Abstract:
A self-similar space is a compact metrizable space endowed with some form of self-similar structure.  We will show that such spaces sometimes admit many homeomorphisms that preserve the self-similar structure, which we refer to as rearrangements of the space.  The resulting groups of rearrangements are closely related to the Thompson groups F, T, and V.  This is joint work with Bradley Forrest.

Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a partition of a finite set $X$. We say that a
transformation $f:X\to X$ stabilises the partition $\mathcal{P}$ if
for all $P\in \mathcal{P}$ there exists $Q\in \mathcal{P}$ such that
$Pf\subseteq Q$. Let  $T(X,\mathcal{P})$ denote the semigroup of all
full transformations of $X$ that preserve the partition $\mathcal{P}$.<br><br>

In 2005 Pei Huisheng found an upper bound for the minimum size of the
generating sets of $T(X,\mathcal{P})$, when  $\mathcal{P}$ is a
partition in which all of its parts have the same size. In addition,
Pei Huisheng conjectured that his bound was exact. In 2009, Ara&uacute;jo
and Schneider used representation theory to solve Pei Huisheng's
conjecture.<br><br>

A more general task is to find the minimum size of the generating sets
of $T(X,\mathcal{P})$, when  $\mathcal{P}$ is an arbitrary partition.
In this talk we presents the solution of this problem and discuss some
of the proof techniques, which range from representation theory to
combinatorial arguments.<br><br>

Title: <i> On the Kreiger types of nonsingular Bernoulli shifts
</i><br>

Abstract:
A measurable transformation $T$ of a probability space 
$(\Omega,\mathcal{B},m)$ is quasi invariant if it preserves the $\sigma$-ideal of measure $0$ sets. An old question of Halmos, which was answered in the affirmative by Ornstein and L. Arnold, is whether there exists such transformations which have recurrent dynamics but there exists no $\sigma$-finite, $m$-absolutely continuous $T$ invariant measures. Such systems are called type $III$. The type $III$ transformations can be further classified according to their Krieger types $III_\lambda, 0 \leq \lambda \leq 1$ where being type $III_1$ is equivalent to the Maharam extension being ergodic.<br><br>
In this talk we will discuss these notions and more in the context of the dynamics of the shift with respect to products measures (not necessarily i.i.d.). If time permits we will discuss an application of these results to symmetric $\alpha$-stable processes, some extensions to the case of the shift of inhomogeneous Markov chain and the construction of a new class of Anosov diffeormorphisms of the torus. <hr>

Title: <i> The parametric family of Bernoulli convolutions
</i><br>
Abstract:
Bernoulli convolutions are arguably the simplest fractal measures on the unit interval, parametrized by a factor t between 0 and 1. They have been studied for almost 80 years, without much success in the overlapping case.  Only for countably many parameters it is exactly known whether the measure admits a density function.
We introduce these measures from the viewpoints of probability, fractals, number systems, and dynamical systems. Then we present a new approach which represents the whole parametric family by a function of two parameters. The structure of that function is studied with computer assistance.

Abstract:
A (bar-joint) framework (G,p) is a graph G, along with a placement p of its vertices into R^d.  A framework is said to be universally rigid if any other (G,q) in *any dimension* $D\geq d$ that has the same edge lengths as (G,p) is related to (G,p) by a rigid body motion.  I'll describe an algebraic characterisation of which graphs G have generic universally rigid frameworks (G,p) and a close connection to a widely used semidefinite programming algorithm for the graph realisation or "distance geometry" problem.<br><br>

Abstract:
The aim is to initiate a ``manifold'' theory for metric Diophantine approximation on the limit sets of Kleinian groups. We investigate the notions of singular and extremal limit points within the geometrically finite Kleinian group framework. Also, we consider the natural analogue of Davenport's problem regarding badly approximable limit points in a given subset of the limit set. Beyond extremality, we discuss potential Khintchine-type statements for subsets of the limit set. These can be interpreted as the conjectural ``manifold'' strengthening of Sullivan's logarithmic law for geodesics.<hr>

Abstract:
Graphons are uncountable limits of sequences of finite graphs.

Title: <i> Fractal substitution tilings and applications to noncommutative geometry
</i><br>

Abstract:
Starting with a substitution tiling, such as the Penrose tiling, we demonstrate a method for constructing infinitely many new substitution tilings. Each of these new tilings is derived from a graph iterated function system and the tiles typically have fractal boundary. As an application of fractal tilings, we construct an odd spectral triple on a C*-algebra associated with an aperiodic substitution tiling. Even though spectral triples on substitution tilings have been extremely well studied in the last 25 years, our construction produces the first truly noncommutative spectral triple associated with a tiling. My work on fractal substitution tilings is joint with Natalie Frank and Sam Webster, and my work on spectral triples is joint with Michael Mampusti.

This provided a new, very accessible example of a group admitting no finitely additive translation invariant probability measure yet not containing a nonabelian free subgroup.  This talk will explore a finitely presented subgroup of Monod's group which is closely related to Thompson's group F and already exhibits these striking properties.

Title: <i> Quasi-ribbons and quasi-crystals</i><br>
Abstract: The plactic monoid (the monoid of Young tableaux) is closely connected
with representations of the special linear Lie
algebra and with the theory of symmetric functions. In particular, the
representation-theoretic notions of Kashiwara
operators and crystal bases can be applied to the plactic monoid in a
purely combinatorial and monoid-theoretical way,
with a very elegant interaction between the resulting crystal
structure and the algebraic and combinatorial properties
of the plactic monoid. Indeed, one can view the crystal structure as
an alternative definition of the plactic monoid.<br><br>

Krob & Thibon showed that the hypoplactic monoid (the monoid of
quasi-ribbon tableaux, and a quotient of the plactic
monoid) has a role for quasi-symmetric functions that is analoguous to
the role of the plactic monoid for symmetric
functions. However, there was no natural crystal structure known for
the hypoplactic monoid.<br><br>

This seminar will describe recent joint work with Malheiro, in which
we detach the notion of Kashiwara operators from
the underlying representation theory, and introduce a notion of
"quasi-Kashiwara operators" that give rise to a
"quasi-crystal" structure for the hypoplactic monoid. This
quasi-crystal structure leads to new results and improved
proofs for known results.  It also sheds light on the relationship
between the plactic monoid, the hypoplactic monoid,
and the sylvester monoid (the monoid of binary search trees).<br><br>

The exposition will be elementary. Representation theory and the
theory of (quasi-)symmetric functions will only appear
for motivation; no special knowledge of these areas will be assumed.

Title: <i> On the ergodic theory and complexity of semigroup actions
</i><br>
Abstract: One of the main purposes of dynamical systems is to understand the behavior
of the space of orbits of continuous group and semigroup actions on compact
metric spaces. For their simplicity,  the most studied and well
understood classes
of such dynamical systems are \(\mathbb Z\), \(\mathbb N\) or \(\mathbb R\)-actions,
which correspond to the dynamics of homeomorphisms, continuous endomorphisms
or continuous flows, respectively. A notion of topological complexity
for such dynamical
systems has been proposed in the seventies and was very well studied
by Goodwin,
Bowen, Walters and Parry, among others. In particular, these dynamical systems
satisfy a variational principle: the topological complexity of the dynamics
is the supremum of the measure theoretical complexity among the space of
invariant probability measures. Such strong relations between the topological
and ergodic features of a dynamical system is still unavailable for
general group
actions. On the one hand, the theory is not unified since
several notions of topological complexity have
been proposed, and many of them depend on properties
of the group action as commutativity or amenability. On the other hand, many
group actions admit no common invariant measures and this notion
should be replaced
by a more flexible concept.<br><br>

In this talk I will first recall the concepts of topological pressure
and the variational principles
for \(\mathbb Z\) and \(\mathbb Z^d\) actions. Then I will propose a notion of
topological entropy  and pressure for finitely generated semigroup
actions and illustrate
how this mimics some of the features of the notion proposed in the
seventies for
\(\mathbb Z\)-actions, namely its regularity and  bounds on the
exponential growth
of periodic orbits in the particular case of finitely generated
semigroups of expanding
maps. Focusing on the later setting for simplicity, we will also
discuss some results on the
ergodic properties of the semigroup dynamics and zeta functions.
These results are part of joint works with F. Rodrigues (UFRGS,
Brazil) and M. Carvalho
(U. Porto, Portugal).

Abstract: A classical result of Gelfand shows that the exponential growth rate of the powers of a matrix is determined by its spectrum.

I will describe some of the difficulties of working with these quantities and give some positive and negative results on their continuity and computability properties. Towards the end of the talk I will apply these results to show that the affinity dimension of a self-affine fractal is a computable function of the linear parts of the affinities.<br>

Abstract: A primitive root is a generator of the (cyclic) multiplicative group of a finite field.   Consecutive elements in a finite field are formed by adding 1. Is it possible to guarantee the existence of two (or more) consecutive primitive roots?   We consider this and other existence questions that can be resolved theoretically, perhaps with the aid of a "feasible" amount of computation.

Abstract: Quasicrystals are ordered but aperiodic discrete point patterns. They were found in diffraction patterns of physical materials in the 80's, but models for quasicrystals, apieriodic tilings, had been investigated as mathematical objects a lot earlier. We give a very short introduction to the topic, describe the cut and project method for producing aperiodic tilings, and make an observation connecting regularity of the cut and project set to Diophantine approximation. We then explain implications of this observation, in both number theory and tiling theory.<br><br>

As an application we obtain that the Patterson-Sullivan measure and other Gibbs measures on certain Fuchsian groups have a power decay for the Fourier transform and in particular showing that they are Rajchman measures. This yields that the limit sets for these Fuchsian groups have positive Fourier dimension and have a prevalence of numbers with strong equidistribution features.

Title: <i> Some infinite permutation groups</i><br>
Abstract: This work (which is joint with Peter Neumann and Simon Smith) began as a study of the structure of  infinite permutation groups G in which point stabilisers  are finite and all infinite normal subgroups are transitive.  This led to a generalisation in which point stabilisers  are merely assumed to satisfy min-N, the minimal condition  on normal subgroups.<br><br> 

The groups G are then of two kinds.   Either they have a maximal finite normal subgroup,  modulo which they have either one or two minimal non-trivial normal subgroups, or they have  a regular normal subgroup M  which is a divisible abelian p-group of finite rank. 
In the latter case the point stabilisers are finite  and act irreducibly on the socle of M.<br>

Title: <i>  Characterising structure in classes with unbounded clique-width</i><br>
Abstract: The clique-width parameter provides a rough measure of the complexity
of structure in (classes of) graphs. A well-known result of Courcelle,
Makowsky and Rotics shows that many problems on graphs which are
NP-hard in general can be solved in polynomial time in any class of
graphs of bounded clique-width. Unlike the better-known treewidth
graph parameter, clique-width respects the induced subgraph ordering,
and in particular it can handle dense graphs. However, also unlike
treewidth there is no known characterisation of the minimal classes of
graphs which have unbounded clique-width.<br><br>

In this talk, I will survey a number of results and techniques for
studying the interface between bounded and unbounded clique-width. Of
particular interest are insights from the combinatorial study of
permutations (``permutation patterns''), which has brought to light
several more minimal graph classes with unbounded clique-width, and
also suggests that a restricted version of the parameter, called
linear clique-width, often appears to characterise the interface.<br><br>

Time-permitting, I will also discuss recent developments and open
problems in the relationship between clique-width and
well-quasi-ordering.<br>

Title: <i> When Artin groups are sufficiently large\(\ldots\)</i><br>
Abstract: An Artin group is a group with a presentation of the form
\[ \langle x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n \mid \overbrace{x_ix_jx_i\cdots}^{m_{ij}}= \overbrace{x_jx_ix_j \cdots}^{m_{ij}}, i,j \in \{1,2,\cdots,n\}, i\neq j\rangle\]
for \(m_{i,j} \in \mathbb{N} \cup \infty, m_{ij} \geq 2\),
which can  be described naturally by a Coxeter matrix or graph.<br><br>

This family of groups contains a wide range of groups,
including braid groups, free groups, free
abelian groups and much else, and its members exhibit a wide range of behaviour.
Many problems remain open for the family as a whole, including the word
problem, but are solved for particular subfamilies. The groups
of finite type (mapping onto finite Coxeter groups), right-angled type
(with each \(m_{ij} \in \{2,\infty\}\)), large and extra-large type (with each
\(m_{ij}\geq 3\) or \(4\)), FC type (every complete subgraph of the
Coxeter graph corresponds to a finite type subgroup)  have been particularly studied. <br><br>

After introducing Artin groups  and surveying what is known,
I will describe recent work with Derek Holt and (sometimes) 
Laura Ciobanu, Eddy Godelle, dealing with a big collection of Artin groups,
containing all the large groups, which we call `sufficiently large'.
For those Artin groups Holt and I have 
elementary descriptions of the sets of geodesic and shortlex
geodesic words, and can reduce any input word to
either form. So we can solve the word problem, and prove the groups
shortlex automatic. 
And, following Appel and Schupp we can solve the conjugacy
problem in extra-large groups in cubic time.<br><br>

For many of the large Artin groups, including all extra-large groups,
Holt, Ciobanu and I can deduce the
rapid decay property and verify the Baum-Connes conjecture.
And although our methods are quite different from those of Godelle and Dehornoy
for spherical-type groups, we can pool our resources and derive a weak form of
hyperbolicity for many, many Artin groups.<br><br>

I'll explain some background for the problems we attach, and outline their
solution.

Title: <i> The combinatorics of web worlds and web diagrams</i><br>
Abstract: We introduce and study a new combinatorial object called a web world. A web world consists of a set of diagrams that we call web diagrams. The motivation for introducing these comes from particle physics, where web diagrams arise as particular types of Feynman diagrams describing scattering amplitudes in non-Abelian gauge (Yang-Mills) theories. <br><br>

The web world of a web diagram is the set of all web diagrams that result from permuting the order in which endpoints of edges appear on a peg. To each web world we associate two matrices called the web-colouring matrix and web-mixing matrix, respectively. The entries of these matrices are indexed by ordered pairs of web diagrams \((D_1,D_2)\), and are computed from those colourings of the edges of \(D_1\) that yield \(D_2\) under a certain transformation determined by each colouring.<br><br>

One of the main goals is the calculation of the web-mixing and web-colouring matrices. In this talk I will give an overview of the results we have obtained so far. These include a decomposition theorems for disjoint web worlds, results pertaining to the diagonal entries of the matrices and how they relate to order preserving maps on posets, and a combinatorial proof of idempotency of the web-mixing matrices<br>

Title: <i> Zeta functions of nilpotent groups</i><br>

Abstract: In asymptotic group theory, one associates to a group \(\Gamma\) a sequence of numbers \(a_n\) and studies the behaviour of \(a_n\) as \(n\) tends to infinity (for instance, \(a_n\) can be the number of subgroups of \(\Gamma\) of index \(n\), or the number of isomorphism classes of irreducible complex representations of \(\Gamma\) of degree \(n\)).  One way to do this is to use the \(a_n\) as the coefficients of a zeta function \(\zeta_\Gamma(s):= \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n n^{-s}\), where \(s\) is a complex parameter.  I will discuss subgroup and representation zeta functions of finitely generated nilpotent groups.  This involves ideas from model theory and \(p\)-adic integration.<br>

Title: <i> Fourier transforms and Minkowski's question mark function</i><br>
Abstract: Minkowski's question mark function is a Holder continuous bijection from the unit interval to itself which maps quadratic irrationals to rationals and can be defined using the continued fraction expansion. It is a singular function and so has 0 derivative almost everywhere (despite being strictly increasing). We will show that it crops up in dynamical systems through the topological conjugacy between the Farey map and the doubling map and as an invariant measure for the Gauss map (\(x \mapsto 1/x \mod 1\)). A natural question to ask about singular function is how their Fourier coefficients behave and in fact Salem asked whether the Fourier coefficients for the Minkowski question mark function decay as n tends to infinity. We will show that by viewing the Minkowski question mark function as an invariant measure for the Gauss map this question can be settled. If time permits we'll discuss some consequences of the Fourier transform of a singular measure decaying polynomially. This is joint work with Tuomas Sahlsten (Jerusalem). <br>

Abstract: The dynamical properties of certain shift spaces are presented. We introduce two new classes of shifts, namely boundedly supermultiplicative (BSM) shifts and balanced shifts. It turns out that any almost specified shift is both BSM and balanced, and any balanced shift is BSM. However, there are examples of shifts which are BSM but not balanced. We also study the measure theoretic properties of balanced shifts and we show that a shift space admits a Gibbs state if and only if it is balanced. The \(S\)-gap shift and the \(\beta\)-shift will be our main examples.<br>

Abstract: James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) was, by any measure, a natural philosopher of the first rank who made wide-ranging contributions to science. He also, however, wrote poetry.<br><br>

In this talk examples of Maxwell's poetry will be discussed in the context of a biographical sketch. It will be  argued that not only was Maxwell a very good poet, but that his poetry enriches our view of his life and its intellectual context.<br>

Title: <i>Deciding the Bell number for hereditary graph properties </i><br>
Abstract: The paper [J. Balogh, B. Bollobas, D. Weinreich, A jump to the Bell number for
hereditary graph properties, J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 95 (2005) 29-48] identifies 
a jump in the speed of hereditary graph properties to the Bell number Bn and 
provides a partial characterisation of the family of minimal classes whose speed 
is at least Bn. In this talk, we give a complete characterisation of this family. Since 
this family is infinite, the decidability of the problem of determining if the speed 
of a hereditary property is above or below the Bell number is questionable. We 
answer this question positively by showing that there exists an algorithm which, 
given a finite set F of graphs, decides whether the speed of the class of graphs 
containing no induced subgraphs from the set F is above or below the Bell number. 
For properties defined by infinitely many minimal forbidden induced subgraphs, 
the speed is known to be above the Bell number.<br><br>

Title: <i>Chains of subsemigroups</i><br>
Abstract: The length of a subgroup chain in a group is bounded by the logarithm of
the group order. This fails for semigroups, but it is perhaps surprising
that there is a lower bound for the length of a subsemigroup chain in the
full transformation semigroup which is a constant multiple of the semigroup
order. In this talk I will discuss the latter, and some related, results.<br><br>

Title: <i>Representation theory for  unitary groups over finite local rings</i><br>
Abstract: 
Let \(L\) be quadratic extension of a \(p\)-adic number field \(K\).
The ring of integers \(\mathcal{O}_L\) has a non-trivial involution
induced by the Galois automorphism of \(L\), which induces an involution
\(*\) on \(M_n(\mathcal{O}_L)\) in a manner that reminds us of the
conjugate-transpose operation.  The resulting unitary group
\(U^*_n(\mathcal{O}_L) = \{ X \in M_n(\mathcal{O}_L): XX^* = I \}\).  <br><br>

The congruence subgroup property implies that any continuous
finite-dimensional representation of \(U_n(\mathcal{O}_L)\) factors
through a congruence subgroup.  This reduces the study of these
representations to that of describing the irreducible representations of
unitary groups over finite local rings.  <br><br>

Recently we have calculated the orders of unitary groups of finite local
rings in both ramified and unramified cases, and constructed irreducible
characters that arise as constituents of the Weil representation of
\(U_n(\mathcal{O}_L)\).  These results rely on tools from Clifford theory
and hermitian geometry that we will explore in this talk.

Title: <i>Counting Acyclic Orientations, and extremal graphs</i><br>
Abstract: Acyclic orientations of graphs are related to the efficient use of radio spectrum on the one hand, and mathematical properties such as graph colouring on the other. In this talk we explore the solution space of acyclic orientations, focusing on the number associated with a given graph. We reveal what is known about the distribution of these numbers, focusing on extreme values. The graphs which provide the minimum value are shown to be extremal for other graph parameters, such as number of cliques and of forests, also. Of particular interest are the maximum values and the graph structures which achieve these. We have many conjectures and pose several open problems to the audience. This talk will highlight computational considerations as well as algebraic properties, illustrate how the two are complementary.
I look forward to hearing about your research in St. Andrews and exploring various possible open problems of joint interest.<br><br>

Title: <i>Normal subgroups of automorphism groups of countable structures</i><br>
Abstract:  It is well known that the symmetric group on a countably infinite set is simple modulo the subgroup of finitary permutations; a similar result holds for countable-dimensional general linear groups. I will describe a sequence of general results, starting off with work of Lascar in 1992, which show that the automorphism groups of certain countable structures are simple, or are simple modulo a normal subgroup of 'bounded' automorphisms. I will discuss some recent applications of these results to structures constructed using Hrushovski amalgamation classes (first saying what these are and why they are interesting).<br><br>

Title: <i>Deciding Maximum Matching without Making Choices </i><br>
Abstract: The study of abstract combinatorial structures, like graphs, and their
associated computational problems has been central to the development
of the theory of algorithmic complexity.  One reason for this is that
such structures provide the right level of abstraction for both
formulating and solving a large variety of problems appearing in
practice.  However, algorithms efficiently solving such problems often
implicitly, and subtly, violate this abstraction when choosing of an
arbitrary element from a set of elements, e.g., as in the selection of
a pivot during the Gaussian elimination algorithm for matrix rank.  In
practice structures are represented in programs by a particular
encoding, say, as a binary string, which contains information external
to the abstraction.  This information can be used to efficiently
implement an arbitrary algorithmic choice, e.g., by selecting the
element with the lexicographically first encoding.  It is a major open
question in descriptive complexity whether such violations of
abstraction are necessary when efficiently solving graph problems.
<br><br>
In this talk I will demonstrate that a host of fundamental
combinatorial and geometric optimization problems can be efficiently
solved on structures without violating their abstraction.  In
particular, I shall describe how to efficiently decide the size of a
maximum matching in a graph without making arbitrary algorithmic
choices, settling an open problem first posed by Blass, Gurevich, and
Shelah.  Along the way to this result, I will show, surprisingly, that
the same can be done for the Ellipsoid Method for linear programming.<br><br>

Title: <i>Dispersing billiards with holes</i><br>

Abstract: Mathematical billiards are popular models from mathematical physics of moving particles undergoing elastic collisions.  In 1979, Pianigiani and Yorke posed the problem of characterizing escape rates and limiting distributions for a chaotic billiard table with small holes.  In this talk, I will introduce the basic set-up and motivating questions in the study of open dynamical systems.  I will then explain how a recently developed framework using functional analysis can be applied to billiard tables with a variety of holes and having either finite or infinite horizon.  Recent results using this approach include the existence of physical limiting conditionally invariant measures, which are the analogue of physical measures for open systems and a variational principle connecting the escape rate to the entropy on the survivor set.

Abstract: A relational structure is homomorphism-homogeneous
if any homomorphism between its finite substructures
extends to an endomorphism of the structure in question.
After providing a short survey of previous results,
I will discuss the characterisation of all permutations
on a finite set enjoying this property, obtained recently
by Ãva JungÃ¡bel and myself. To this end, I will review the
more traditional view of a permutation as a set endowed with
two linear orders (which eventually led to the theory of
permutation patterns), and then switch to a different
representation by a single linear order (considered as a
directed graph with loops) whose non-loop edges are
coloured in two colours, thereby 'splitting' the linear
order into two posets.

We will pay particular attention to the synthesis of ideas from harmonic analysis and analytic number theory.

Title: <i> Matrix algebras and K3 surfaces</i><br>

Abstract: A K3 surface is a kind of two-dimensional analogue of the elliptic curve or complex torus.  In theoretical physics, one is interested in dualities between pairs of K3 surfaces and (vector bundles of) matrix algebras.  An extensive theoretical framework has been developed to determine criteria for such dualites; however, there are not many explicit examples.  We use Clifford algebras to construct an explicit example on a particular K3 surface.  The corresponding duality is the inverse of a classical example due to Mukai.  Based on joint work with Colin Ingalls.<br>

Title: <i> Title: Rational moment generating functions and polyhedra in \(R^d\).</i><br>

Abstract:
The problem of reconstructing a measure in \(R^d\) from a (truncated)
multi-sequence of its moments has important applications, and is in
general very hard to solve. We concentrate on a natural case of a
measure \(\mu\) with piecewise-polynomial density supported on a compact
polyhedron P, and show that such problems can be solved exactly, due
to existence of a natural integral transform of the measure (known as Fantappie
transformation), which is
a rational function \(F_\mu(u)\). The denominator of \(F_\mu(u)\) is the product
of linear functions of the form \( 1-\langle u,v\rangle \), with \(v\) belonging to
certain finite multiset V(P).<br><br>

There are interesting applications of \(F_\mu(u)\) to compact (not
necessarily convex) polyhedra. Let \(I(P)\) be the indicator function of
\(P\). Then \(I(P)\) can be decomposed (up to a measure 0 subset) as a sum,
with real coefficients, of \(I(D)\), where \(D\) runs through simplices with
vertices in \(V(P)\). This can be viewed as a non-convex generalisation of
triangulations of convex polytopes. Laplace
transforms of cones related to such decompositions arise in the theory
of hyperplane
arrangements.
Further refinements and applications will be discussed.<br>

Title: <i> Entropy for generalised beta-transformations</i><br>

Abstract:
Generalised beta-transformations are the class of piecewise continuous interval maps given by taking the beta-transformation \(x\mapsto \beta x \mod1\), where \(\beta > 1\), and replacing some of the branches with branches of constant negative slope. We would like to describe the set of beta for which these maps can admit a Markov partition. We know that beta (which is the exponential of the entropy of the map) must be an algebraic number. Our main result is that the Galois conjugates of such beta have modulus less than 2. This extends an analysis of Solomyak for the case of beta-transformations, who obtained a sharp bound of the golden mean in that setting.<br><br>

I will also describe a connection with some of the results of Thurston's fascinating final paper, where the Galois conjugates of entropies of post-critically finite unimodal maps are shown to describe a beautiful fractal. The talk will be suitable for non-specialists, and all technical terms in this abstract will be explained!<br>

Title: <i> The Hausdorff dimension of not uniquely ergodic 4-interval exchange
transformations has codimension 1/2</i><br>

Abstract: Interval Exchange Transformations are invertible piecewise order
preserving isometries of the unit interval that generalize rotations.
Masur and Veech independently showed that they are typically uniquely
ergodic. There are know to be minimal and not uniquely ergodic interval
exchanges. In interests of quantifying the size of this measure 0 (and
meager) set the main results of this talk are:<br><br>

a) The Hausdorff dimension of not-uniquely 4-IETs is 2 1/2 as a subset of
the 3 dimensional simplex<br>

b) The Hausdorff dimension of flat surfaces in H(2) whose vertical flow is
not uniquely ergodic is 7 1/2 as a subset of an 8 dimensional space<br>

c) For almost every flat surface in H(2) the set of directions where the
flow is not uniquely ergodic has Hausdorff dimension 1/2.<br><br>

These results all say that the Hausdorff codimension of these exceptional
sets is 1/2.  Masur-Smillie showed that the Hausdorff codimension was less
than 1. It follows from work of Masur that the Hausdorff codimension is at
least 1/2. This is joint work with J. Athreya.
