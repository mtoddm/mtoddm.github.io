The study of abstract combinatorial structures, like graphs, and their
associated computational problems has been central to the development
of the theory of algorithmic complexity.  One reason for this is that
such structures provide the right level of abstraction for both
formulating and solving a large variety of problems appearing in
practice.  However, algorithms efficiently solving such problems often
implicitly, and subtly, violate this abstraction when choosing of an
arbitrary element from a set of elements, e.g., as in the selection of
a pivot during the Gaussian elimination algorithm for matrix rank.  In
practice structures are represented in programs by a particular
encoding, say, as a binary string, which contains information external
to the abstraction.  This information can be used to efficiently
implement an arbitrary algorithmic choice, e.g., by selecting the
element with the lexicographically first encoding.  It is a major open
question in descriptive complexity whether such violations of
abstraction are necessary when efficiently solving graph problems.

In this talk I will demonstrate that a host of fundamental
combinatorial and geometric optimization problems can be efficiently
solved on structures without violating their abstraction.  In
particular, I shall describe how to efficiently decide the size of a
maximum matching in a graph without making arbitrary algorithmic
choices, settling an open problem first posed by Blass, Gurevich, and
Shelah.  Along the way to this result, I will show, surprisingly, that
the same can be done for the Ellipsoid Method for linear programming.<br><br>
