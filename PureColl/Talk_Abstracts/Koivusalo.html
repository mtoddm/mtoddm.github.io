We go through a few examples of fractal sets and the definition of Hausdorff dimension, and list some classical results in dimension theory of fractal sets. Keeping the examples in mind, we take a general look at ways for finding the Hausdorff dimension. We finish with some recent results in the field, connecting them to this general framework.
