Welcome to the Real Analysis (MT3502) course webpage.  Most of the information on this course, tutorial sheets etc., can be downloaded from Moodle via <a href="https://mysaint.st-andrews.ac.uk/">MySaint</a>.  The official description of this course is <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/modules/catalogue/?code=MT3502&academic_year=2022/3">here</a>.  This course follows on from MT2502, so before taking it make sure you have revised the material in MT2502 - there is a short summary of that on the MT3502 Moodle page, which you should look at.

<font size="+1"><b>Tutorials</b></font><br><br>

The tutorials will primarily focus on the tutorial sheet questions for that week.  Each student should attend one tutorial per week, starting in week 2.  There will be a process for you to sign up to either the Monday or the Thursday slot.

<HR>

<font size="+1"><b>Tutorial Sheets</b></font><br><br>


There will be tutorial questions set for each week.  These are not assessed, but if you would like feedback you will be able to hand in work for that, starting in week 2.


<!--
<li>
You must include 3 pieces of information on your work: i) your name; ii) your tutor's name; iii) your tutorial group number.</li>
<li>
The work should be handed into the MT2502 box by Theatre B in the maths institute by 2pm on Monday of the odd week.</li>-->


<HR>

<font size="+1"><b>Class test</b></font><br><br>

There will be a class test on Tuesday 25th Oct (in the usual lecture slot).  This counts for 10% of your final mark.
