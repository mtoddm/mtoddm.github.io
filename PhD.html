I am very happy to supervise PhD students who share an interest in Ergodic Theory and Dynamical systems.
 In particular I'm interested in non uniformly hyperbolic maps in low dimensions, which can have very different
 statistical properties to the classical uniformly hyperbolic case.  I often explore these properties using the 
 structure of thermodynamic formalism.  Further information on my interests can be inferred from my <a href="papers.html">papers</a>.<br><br>

After looking at that page, if you're still interested in the possibility of coming to St Andrews to do
 a PhD as part of the <a href="https://analysis.rutar.org/">analysis group</a> you could look at the
 <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics/prospective/pgr/">school page</a> on postgraduate research. 
 Also you can email me at m.todd -at- st-andrews.ac.uk.  For funding possibilities see the school page above and
 <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/fees-and-funding/postgraduate/">here</a>.
