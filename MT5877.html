Welcome to the Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems (MT5877) course webpage.  If you need any information that you can't find here, please email me.  Chaotic dynamical systems are by definition difficult to analyse, and one of the most powerful approaches is to view the system through its associated measures (MT5865 is a prerequisite here - note any reference to MT5825 refers to a previous version of Measure Theory, which also works as a prerequisite here, but no longer runs).  Then the system can be characterised via its average properties (with respect to that measure), its statistical limit laws (mixing properties, probabilistic theorems), as well as which measures the system supports.  This course introduces dynamical systems and their associated measures and then covers basic recurrence theorems.  There will also be an extensive discussion of entropy, which provides an important characterisation of the system (a measure of how chaotic the system is).
The official description of this course is <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/modules/catalogue/?code=MT5877&academic_year=2025%2F6">here</a>.
