<font size="+1">

Welcome to Real Analysis (MT3502).   
  Most of the information on this course, tutorial sheets etc., can be downloaded from 
  Moodle via <a href="https://mysaint.st-andrews.ac.uk/">MySaint</a> (the course notes will be there and material will be made available in advance of the corresponding lectures, but the notes will be released in stages).  
  The official description of this course is <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/modules/catalogue/?meta_semester_sand=1&meta_modulecode=MT3502&meta_ayrs_sand=2025%2F6">here</a>.
  This course follows on from MT2502, so before taking it make sure you have revised the material in MT2502
  - there is a short summary of that on the MT3502 Moodle page, which you should look at.

<font size="+1"><b>Tutorials</b></font><br><br>

The tutorials will primarily focus on the tutorial sheet questions for that week.  
  Each student should attend one tutorial per week, starting in week 2.  
  The School admin team will send emails explaining the process for you to sign up to either the Tuesday
  or the Thursday slot, this will happen at some point before the end of Week 1.<br>
 

<HR>

<font size="+1"><b>Tutorial Sheets</b></font><br><br>


There will be tutorial questions set for each week.  These are not assessed, but you are strongly encouraged to 
  work through them each week prior to your tutorial.  There will also be opportunities to get feedback on 
  work, the process for this will be announced in class: this will be voluntary and not part of assessment for the course.


<!--
<li>
You must include 3 pieces of information on your work: i) your name; ii) your tutor's name; iii) your tutorial group number.</li>
<li>
The work should be handed into the MT2502 box by Theatre B in the maths institute by 2pm on Monday of the odd week.</li>-->


<HR>

<font size="+1"><b>Class test</b></font><br><br>

There will be a class test after the first half of the course in one of the lecture slots, details TBA.  This counts for 10% of your final mark.<br><br>
  
  Note that students entitled to extra time will be contacted by the admin team and their tests will be arranged around the standard class test time.
